description: Graph databases are an "emerging" technology useful in the field of cybersecurity, especially in the detection of new threats based on the correlation of diverse sources of information. However, insufficient attention has been spent in terms of its security. In this talk, it will be reviewed the state of art of this kind of databases and its desing security problems, specially for Neo4J and OrientDB. We will release a hacking tool for testing and detecting graph databases and will show several examples of information leak in the real world.
